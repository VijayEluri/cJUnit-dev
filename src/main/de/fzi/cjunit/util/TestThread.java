/**
 * A {@link Thread} subclass to make handling exceptions in threads easier.
 * <p>
 * Not necessary for ConcurrentTests.
 * <p>
 * Sometimes one needs to write a concurrent unit test in which the code
 * executed in (one of) the created thread(s) can throw an exception if
 * something goes wrong.  But an exception thrown in a thread will be caught
 * by the JVM, not by the testing framework, and, consequently, the testing
 * framework will not know about the test's failure.  Furthermore, the code
 * executed in a created thread might throw checked exceptions, but since
 * {@link Thread#run()} doesn't allow checked exceptions the developer must
 * deal with those exceptions.
 *
 * <pre>
 *   TestThread t = new TestThread() {
 *       public void explodableRun() throws Throwable {
 *           throw new Throwable("Something always goes wrong...");
 *       }
 *   };
 *   t.start();
 *   t.joinExplosively();    // rethrows the Throwable created in the thread
 * </pre>
